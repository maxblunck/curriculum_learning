we should also take a look at our own situation , however .
commissioner , you said that you were against a number of amendments .
but we need to go further than this .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
that is why our resolution is important , and i have voted for it .
we need to go further .
they need the help of the member states .

the problem of course , is what should we , as the european union , do now ?
after all , we know what the issue is .
thank you , commissioner .
i very much hope that will be one result of this .
thank you again and i know we can find the solution together .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
do you not want there to be a resolution ?
this is my concern on this issue .
we all know that .
that too would have to be taken into account .
welcome
that is not my view .
president , i welcome this initiative from the commission .
( parliament adopted the resolution )
that is the second problem .
